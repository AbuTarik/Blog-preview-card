## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I gained a better understanding of how to create visually appealing card components using CSS. I learned how to use properties like box-shadow to add depth, transition to create smooth hover effects, and gap to space out elements within flex containers. These techniques helped me build a clean and interactive design that enhances user experience

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0.8rem 1rem black;
  transition: 0.2s;
  gap: 0.75rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to deepen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, especially focusing on writing clean, accessible, and scalable code. I also plan to improve my frontend development abilities by exploring frameworks like React or Vue. On the backend side, I want to gain more experience with Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB or SQL. My long-term goal is to become a Full Stack Developer, capable of building complete, efficient, and responsive web applications from start to finish.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This interactive guide helped me better understand how Flexbox works, especially in aligning and distributing space within containers. I found the visual examples very effective, and I plan to use Flexbox more confidently in future layouts.
